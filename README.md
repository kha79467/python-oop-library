This project demonstrates the power of Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by modeling a Smart Library System. It focuses purely on OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, simulating a real-world scenario in a human-centered way.


Features
Abstract Classes: Book defines a blueprint for all book types.
Inheritance & Polymorphism: PrintedBook and EBook inherit from Book; Member and Librarian inherit from User.
Encapsulation: Borrow history is private and managed through class methods.
Real-world Simulation: Borrowing, adding books, and tracking history mimic real library operations.
Human Touch: Models users and interactions in a way that feels intuitive and personal.
